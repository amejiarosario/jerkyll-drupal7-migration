V. Mihál and M. Bieliková presents “An Approach to Annotation of Learning Texts on Programming within a Web-Based Educational System”. This work leverage the usage of annotation to enhance programming learning experience. Annotations provide to learners supplementary information that they otherwise will have to find by themselves somewhere else.  They describe different types of annotation: manual and automatic. For the manual annotations the user the user provides insert related notes to material. Automatic annotation are done without human intervention. It uses ontologies and language processing to identify related content and insert it in the appropriated place.
